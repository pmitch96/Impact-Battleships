# Impact-Battleships

1. Things to change and improve:
2. Make the board a proper class, be able to call it in the main function and have the print board be a method called something like printBoard() you can call in main.
3. Reduce repitition and make the code cleaner/more efficient.
4. Be able to display a message when the ship has been sunk.
5. Restrict the placement of boats and streamline the boat placing process.
6. Restrict scanner input for missiles so that the game doesn't crash if input not on the board is put in.
