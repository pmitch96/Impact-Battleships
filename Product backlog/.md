# Impact-Battleships

Things to change and improve:
1. Turn the Missile input/gameplay into a method to be called
2. Be able to display a message when the ship has been sunk.
3. Restrict the placement of boats and streamline the boat placing process.
4. Restrict scanner input for missiles so that the game doesn't crash if input not on the board is put in.
